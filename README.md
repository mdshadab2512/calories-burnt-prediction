Calories_burnt_Prediction_Project

The project aims to predict calories burnt by any person during exercise using Machine learning Techniques.By analyzing various features and attributes of dataset such as body temperature,duration of exercise,etc.,we can build a model that can predict the calories burnt.

i)   The dataset is taken from kaggle which contains two csv files name exercise.csv and calories.csv

ii)  The machine learning model employed in the project is XGBOOST Regressor model.

iii  We have chosen Mean Absolute Error as a metric to compare accuracy

iv)  After being trained on model,the model has mean absolute error of 1.48% on test set which is quite well.
